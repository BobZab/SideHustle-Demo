## 📖 About The Game

**SideHustle** is a dark comedy simulation game developed for the Western Colorado University Game Jam 2025.

While the theme of the jam was **"Critters,"** this project takes a morbid spin on the concept. Rather than befriending the local wildlife, you are tasked with a gritty entrepreneurial challenge. Catching, processing, and selling critters to save up money and keep the lights on.

It features a unique retro aesthetic and management mechanics set within a dingy apartment complex.
